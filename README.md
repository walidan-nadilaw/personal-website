👋 Hello! I'm Walid, a passionate first-year computer science major at IPB University.

🚀 this is the first project that I build using HTML and CSS. I might add more features as I deepend my understanding of Web Developement
🤝 I'm interested in doing projects and collaborating with passionate individuals for a common goal.
If you need my help for a project, I will gladly donate my knowledge and experience to create meaningful solutions.
